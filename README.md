 # Problem Statement

How often have you walked past a street in your locality and saw a pile of garbage that has been there for weeks? How often is it when you're driving and you encounter a pothole so deep it can lead to serious accidents? Or how about the sore sight that open drains provide apart from the health hazards?

Most of the times these things in your locality don't get noticed by the bodies of the system, the municipalities. Sometimes an RTI or sometimes a complaint letter needs to be sent to the Municipal Corporations to get these things sorted and in order. And we all know the time it takes for some action to be taken. So is this problem solvable?


# Proposed Solution

Bridge the ultra-wide gap between municipalities and citizens of a particular area/locality/city. Bring transparency by providing the end-users visual references of the resolved complaint. Our product will enable the users to register hassle-free complaints using the app instead of the old school method of paperwork or registration of complaints at the municipality offices.
